/**
 * Concrete implementation of {@link AbstractSystemUserAuthenticator} that uses the simple form-based
 * log-in process to authenticate the current user.
 *
 * <h2>How it works</h2>
 *
 * If authentication is deemed required (by the superclass), then the user is forwarded to
 * the JSP login page. This JSP should contain a form containing the following
 * parameters to fill in:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link SystemUserAuthenticationServlet#LOGIN_NAME_PARAM}: user ID</li>
 *   <li>{@link SystemUserAuthenticationServlet#PASSWORD_PARAM}: password</li>
 *   <li>{@link SystemUserAuthenticationServlet#PROTECTED_REQUEST_URI_PARAM}: the URL of "this" Resource</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The JSP should submit to the {@link SystemUserAuthenticationServlet} to check the provided user ID
 * and password. The URL of the current Resource is also passed so that the user can be redirected
 * to it once authentication and authorisation has succeeded.
 *
